# Current folders and files of significance:

* For patch antenna design of phased array see files in "AnsysHFSS"
* For HackRF and Pluto transmitter code see files in "GNU Radio"
* For delay and sum beamforming algorithm see:
  * "Python": "delay_and_sum_synthesis.ipynb"
  * "MATLAB": "delay_and_sum_synthesis.ipynb" (same implementation as python code but easier to visualize matrix math)
  * "PYNQ": "beamforming_testing.ipynb" (in construction, high-level implementation)
* For beamforming IP block (in construction, low-level implementation of delay and sum algorithm) see files in "HDL"

# Delay and sum algorithm synthesized by "delay_and_sum_synthesis.ipynb" in "python"
