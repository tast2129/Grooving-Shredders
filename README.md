# Project Background

For 8 months, our team worked to build a digital beamforme in the FPGA fabric of the RFSoC 4x2 by AMD Xilinx. Although we ran out of time to fully debug the hardware configuration we developed, we learned a lot about the board, RF, DSP and generated some pretty cool results along the way. All radiation patterns seen below were generated by our custom test system.

# Delay and sum algorithm synthesized by "delay_and_sum_synthesis.ipynb" in "Python"

Whenever a transmitter located at some angle off of a phased array's broadside, each element receives the same signal with a different phase shift:

If we try to sum the signal received by the 4 elements, we get a lot of nonsense:

Instead, let's undo the phase shifts by multiplying each element's data by beamforming weights calculated using simple trig and the known angle of the transmitter off of the array's broadside and the spacing of the elements in the array:

Now when we sum the signal received by the 4 elements, not only have we received the original transmitted signal, but with around 4x the amplitude!
